By combining several datasets, this research can find patterns, pinpoint high-risk populations, and investigate relationships between the occurrence of stroke and lifestyle factors like obesity. Allocating resources and developing focused public health policies could be influenced by these observations. Clinicians may use predictive models based on this data to evaluate stroke risk and carry out early interventions for healthcare organizations. Comprehending geographical and demographic disparities also helps policymakers create customized community health programs that encourage proactive stroke prevention and improved patient care.\n"
